## Overview

This guide provides a systematic approach to troubleshooting Jellyfin access issues when connecting via a public domain. Follow each step in order - if a step passes, move to the next one. If a step fails, resolve that issue completely before continuing to the next step.

### Common Symptoms

- Cannot access Jellyfin via your public domain (e.g., `jellyfin.yourdomain.com`)
- Connection timeouts or "site can't be reached" errors
- Unexpected redirects or redirect loops
- SSL/TLS certificate errors
- Jellyfin loads but shows incorrect URLs or paths

### Prerequisites

Before starting this troubleshooting guide, ensure you have:
- A registered domain name
- Jellyfin server running locally
- Caddy reverse proxy configured
- Basic understanding of your network setup

## Step 1: Verify Port Accessibility

The first step is to ensure your ports **443** (HTTPS) and **80** (HTTP) are accessible from the internet.

### Check Port Status

1. **Go to [portchecker.io](https://portchecker.io/)**
2. **Enter your public IP address** (find it at [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/))
3. **Test port 443** - Enter `443` and click "Check Port"
4. **Test port 80** - Enter `80` and click "Check Port"

### Expected Results

✅ **PASS**: Both ports show as **"Open"** or **"Accessible"**
❌ **FAIL**: One or both ports show as **"Closed"** or **"Filtered"**

### If Ports Are Closed - Fix Before Continuing

If either port is closed, you need to resolve this before proceeding:

#### Router Port Forwarding

1. **Access your router's admin panel** (usually `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`)
2. **Navigate to Port Forwarding settings** (may be under "Advanced" or "NAT")
3. **Create port forwarding rules**:
   - **Port 80**: Forward to your server's local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100:80`)
   - **Port 443**: Forward to your server's local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100:443`)
4. **Save settings and restart router**

#### Windows Firewall Configuration

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="gui" label="GUI Method" default>

1. **Open Control Panel** → **System and Security** → **Windows Defender Firewall**
2. **Click "Advanced settings"**
3. **Select "Inbound Rules"** → **Click "New Rule"**
4. **Select "Port"** → **Next**
5. **Select "TCP"** → **Specific local ports**: `80, 443`
6. **Select "Allow the connection"** → **Next**
7. **Apply to all profiles** → **Next**
8. **Name the rule** (e.g., "Jellyfin Caddy Ports") → **Finish**

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell Method">

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Jellyfin HTTP" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 80 -Action Allow
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Jellyfin HTTPS" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 443 -Action Allow

# Verify rules were created
Get-NetFirewallRule | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*Jellyfin*"}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Linux Firewall Configuration

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ufw" label="UFW (Ubuntu/Debian)" default>

```bash
# Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

# Check status
sudo ufw status
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="firewalld" label="Firewalld (CentOS/RHEL)">

```bash
# Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Check status
sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**After making firewall changes, retest ports at [portchecker.io](https://portchecker.io/) before continuing.**

---

## Step 2: Verify DNS Resolution

Once ports are confirmed open, verify that your domain resolves to the correct public IP address.

### Check DNS Resolution

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and run:

```cmd
nslookup jellyfin.yourdomain.com
```

Replace `jellyfin.yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux/macOS">

Open **Terminal** and run:

```bash
nslookup jellyfin.yourdomain.com
# or
dig jellyfin.yourdomain.com
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Expected Results

✅ **PASS**: The command returns your **public IP address**
❌ **FAIL**: Returns wrong IP, no IP, or "can't find" error

### Example of Correct Output

```
Server:  dns.google
Address:  8.8.8.8

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    jellyfin.yourdomain.com
Address:  203.0.113.45  # This should match your public IP
```

### If DNS Resolution Fails - Fix Before Continuing

#### Check Domain DNS Settings

1. **Log into your domain registrar** (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)
2. **Navigate to DNS settings** for your domain
3. **Verify A record exists**:
   - **Name**: `jellyfin` (or `@` for root domain)
   - **Type**: `A`
   - **Value**: Your public IP address
   - **TTL**: `300` or `Auto`

#### Common DNS Issues

- **Wrong IP Address**: Update A record with correct public IP
- **Missing A Record**: Create new A record pointing to your public IP
- **TTL Too High**: Lower TTL to 300 seconds for faster propagation
- **DNS Propagation**: Wait 24-48 hours for global DNS propagation

#### Test DNS Propagation

Use [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to check DNS propagation globally:
1. Enter your domain (`jellyfin.yourdomain.com`)
2. Select "A" record type
3. Verify it shows your public IP in multiple locations

**Wait for DNS to fully propagate before continuing to the next step.**

## Step 3: Test Browser Connectivity and Analyze Network Traffic

With ports open and DNS resolving correctly, test browser connectivity and analyze network traffic for issues.

### Open Browser Developer Tools

1. **Open your browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools
3. **Go to the "Network" tab**
4. **Ensure "Preserve log" is checked**
5. **Clear any existing entries**

### Navigate to Your Domain

1. **Enter your Jellyfin URL**: `https://jellyfin.yourdomain.com`
2. **Press Enter** and watch the Network tab

### Analyze Network Traffic

Look for the following in the Network tab:

#### ✅ **PASS Indicators**

- **Status 200**: Successful response from Jellyfin
- **Response Headers** show `server: Caddy` (confirms traffic reaching Caddy)
- **No redirect loops** (no excessive 301/302 responses)
- **Jellyfin loads correctly**

#### ❌ **FAIL Indicators**

- **Connection timeout**: No response at all
- **SSL/TLS errors**: Certificate issues
- **Status 502/503**: Backend connection issues
- **Redirect loops**: Multiple 301/302 responses
- **Wrong redirects**: Redirecting to incorrect URLs

### Check Response Headers

Click on the main request in the Network tab and look at **Response Headers**:

```
server: Caddy
content-type: text/html
content-length: 12345
```

If you see `server: Caddy`, traffic is reaching your reverse proxy correctly.

**Alternative CLI Check**: You can also verify Caddy is responding using curl:
```bash
curl -I https://jellyfin.yourdomain.com
# Look for "Server: Caddy" in the response headers
```

### Common Network Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Connection Timeout
**Symptoms**: No response, request hangs
**Solutions**:
- Verify Caddy is running: `sudo systemctl status caddy` (Linux) or check Services.msc (Windows)
- Check Caddy configuration syntax: `caddy validate --adapter caddyfile --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile`
- Restart Caddy: `sudo systemctl restart caddy` (Linux) or restart service (Windows)

#### Issue: SSL/TLS Certificate Errors
**Symptoms**: "Your connection is not private" warnings
**Solutions**:
- Check Caddy logs: `sudo journalctl -u caddy -f`
- Verify domain ownership for Let's Encrypt
- Ensure port 80 is accessible (required for certificate validation)

#### Issue: 502/503 Backend Errors
**Symptoms**: "Bad Gateway" or "Service Unavailable"
**Solutions**:
- Verify Jellyfin is running: `sudo systemctl status jellyfin` (Linux) or check Services.msc (Windows)
- Check Jellyfin is listening on correct port: `netstat -tlnp | grep 8096` (Linux) or `netstat -an | findstr 8096` (Windows)
- Verify Caddy upstream configuration points to correct Jellyfin address

---

## Step 4: Check for Redirect Issues

If you're experiencing redirect loops or incorrect redirects, this step will help identify and resolve them.

### Identify Redirect Problems

Look for these patterns in the Network tab:

#### ❌ **Problematic Redirects**

- `jellyfin.yourdomain.com` → `jellyfin.yourdomain.com/jellyfin.yourdomain.com/web`
- Multiple 301/302 responses in a loop
- Redirects to internal IP addresses
- Redirects to wrong ports

#### ✅ **Normal Redirects**

- `jellyfin.yourdomain.com` → `jellyfin.yourdomain.com/web` (single redirect)
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect (expected)

### Check Jellyfin Base URL Setting

If you see incorrect redirects (especially double domain names), check Jellyfin's Base URL setting:

1. **Access Jellyfin directly** via local IP: `http://192.168.1.100:8096`
2. **Log in as administrator**
3. **Go to Dashboard** → **Networking**
4. **Check "Base URL" field**

#### ✅ **Correct Base URL Settings**

- **Leave empty** for most setups (recommended)
- **Set to subpath** only if serving under a subdirectory (e.g., `/jellyfin`)

#### ❌ **Incorrect Base URL Settings**

- Set to full domain: `https://jellyfin.yourdomain.com`
- Set to subdirectory that doesn't match Caddy config
- Contains double slashes or malformed paths

### Fix Base URL Configuration

1. **Clear the Base URL field** (leave it empty unless serving under a subpath)
2. **Click "Save"**
3. **Restart Jellyfin**: `sudo systemctl restart jellyfin` (Linux) or restart service (Windows)
4. **Test access** via your domain again

### Verify Caddy Configuration

Check your Caddy configuration for proper reverse proxy setup:

```caddyfile
jellyfin.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8096
}
```

**Common Caddy Configuration Issues**:
- Missing or incorrect upstream address
- Conflicting site blocks
- Incorrect header forwarding

### Test After Changes

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Open new incognito/private window**
3. **Navigate to your domain again**
4. **Check Network tab** for clean redirect pattern

---

## Step 5: Final Verification and Testing

Once all previous steps pass, perform final verification to ensure everything works correctly.

### Complete Functionality Test

1. **Access Jellyfin** via your domain: `https://jellyfin.yourdomain.com`
2. **Log in** with your credentials
3. **Navigate through the interface**:
   - Browse libraries
   - Play a media file
   - Check settings pages
4. **Verify all URLs** remain on your domain (no internal IPs showing)

### Test from External Network

1. **Use mobile data** or ask someone on a different network to test
2. **Verify access works** from outside your local network
3. **Test both HTTP and HTTPS** (HTTP should redirect to HTTPS)

### Monitor Logs for Issues

Check logs for any remaining issues:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="caddy" label="Caddy Logs" default>

```bash
# View Caddy logs
sudo journalctl -u caddy -f

# Look for errors or warnings
sudo journalctl -u caddy --since "1 hour ago" | grep -i error
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jellyfin" label="Jellyfin Logs">

```bash
# View Jellyfin logs
sudo journalctl -u jellyfin -f

# Check Jellyfin log files (location varies by installation method)
# Common locations: /var/log/jellyfin/, ~/.local/share/jellyfin/logs/, or check systemd logs above
find /var/log -name "*jellyfin*" 2>/dev/null || echo "Use journalctl -u jellyfin for systemd logs"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Performance Verification

1. **Test streaming performance** - Play a high-quality video
2. **Check response times** - Pages should load quickly
3. **Verify SSL certificate** - Should show valid certificate in browser

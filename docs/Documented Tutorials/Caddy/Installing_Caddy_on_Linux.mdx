2. Installing Caddy

:::caution
**You Need to Note to Add the Cloudflare and Duckdns Plugins before Downloading**
:::

[Caddy Download](https://caddyserver.com/download?package=github.com%2Fcaddy-dns%2Fcloudflare&package=github.com%2Fcaddy-dns%2Fduckdns)

2. Once Downloaded lets go to the directory we downloaded it to 

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

3. You need to rename caddy from the downloaded name to caddy

```bash
sudo mv caddy_linux_amd64_custom ./caddy
```

and check to make sure its correct now 

```bash
ls
```

4. You have to give caddy read, write and execute permissions by running

```bash
sudo chmod +x caddy
```

5. Check to make sure the permissions are now correct for caddy by running 

```bash
ls -la
```

6. Copy the Caddy binary the execution folder where we can run it in the OS.

```bash
sudo cp caddy /usr/bin/
```

7. Check to make sure its able to be run and executed 

```bash
caddy version
```

8. You should recieve an output like this

![image](https://i.imgur.com/cQ1o0UQ.png)

9. Now you need to create a group named caddy

```bash
sudo groupadd --system caddy
```

10. Also create a user named caddy with writeable home directory

```bash
sudo useradd --system \
    --gid caddy \
    --create-home \
    --home-dir /var/lib/caddy \
    --shell /usr/sbin/nologin \
    --comment "Caddy web server" \
    caddy
```

11. You have to go into the systemd directory to make the file

```bash
cd /etc/systemd/system
```

12. Create our caddy.service file

```bash
sudo nano caddy.service
```


13. Paste below in our caddy.service so it starts on boot

```bash
# caddy.service
#
# For using Caddy with a config file.
#
# Make sure the ExecStart and ExecReload commands are correct
# for your installation.
#
# See https://caddyserver.com/docs/install for instructions.
#
# WARNING: This service does not use the --resume flag, so if you
# use the API to make changes, they will be overwritten by the
# Caddyfile next time the service is restarted. If you intend to
# use Caddy's API to configure it, add the --resume flag to the
# `caddy run` command or use the caddy-api.service file instead.

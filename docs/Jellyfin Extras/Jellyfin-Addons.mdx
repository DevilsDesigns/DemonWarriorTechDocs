### JF-Secure

Description: There are many great reverse-proxy tools available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs and was user friendly for beginner users, so I decided to take open source software like Caddy Web-server and WinSSW to create a tool stack that will reverse-proxy Jellyfin for you. I wanted it to be automated and easy to use, even for novice users.
